<P>Mouse coordinates: clientX(Y),pageX(Y)
There is a great cross-browser property pair clientX/clientY which contain coordinates<BR/>
 relative to window.

If your window is 500x500, and the mouse is in the center, then clientX and clientY are 
both equal to 250.
If you scroll down, left or up without moving the mouse - the values of clientX/clientY don't change, 
because they are relative to the window, not the document.
Move the mouse over the input to see clientX/clientY
</P>
<input onmousemove="this.value = event.clientX+':'+event.clientY">
<P>
The W3C standard provides a property pair pageX/pageY for that.

If your window is 500x500, and the mouse is in the middle, then both pageX and pageY equal 250.
If you scroll it 250 pixels down, the value of pageY becomes 500.

So, the pair pageX/pageY contains coordinates relative to document top-left corner, with all scrolls.

They are supported by all browsers except IE&lt;9.

Move the mouse over the input to see pageX/pageY (except IE &lt;9):</P><BR/>
